Tell me why you came, tell me why you're here
Tell me why your voice is always ringing in my ear
You wanna be the man hanging with my crew?
Who the hell let you through?
I see you're always at my shows, always with my bros
Always finding places where I think nobody goes
I can't seem to shake you from this
So now I'll have to break you from this!
